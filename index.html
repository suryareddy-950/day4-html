     <h1>Ingredients for Creamy Garlic Chicken biryani </h1>
     <p>Here’s everything you need to make this creamy garlic chicken recipe:</p>
     <ul>
<h2><li>chicken biryani:</li></h2>
    
    <p>If you’ve seen a couple of my recipes, then by now you probably know I love using chicken breasts. So I opted for two boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cut in half. But you can certainly use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead.</p>
    
    <h2><li></li>All-purpose floure :</li></h2>
    <p>A little bit of flour adds a light breading to the chicken breasts and the perfect compliment to the creamy garlic sauce.</p>
    <h2><li>Garlic:</li></h2>
    <p> Garlic is the star of the show for this dish, so we’re using lots of it. One whole head of garlic to be exact. The garlic cooks down and infuses the sauce without overpowering the dish.</p> 
    <h2><li>Olive Oil and Butter:</li></h2>
    <p>Both are used to cook the chicken breasts and a little more butter is used to sauté the garlic cloves.</p> 
    <h2><li>Chicken biryani Broth and Heavy Cream:</li></h2>
    <p>The rich garlic sauce is made with a combination of chicken broth and heavy cream. Both of them simmer together, along with the garlic cloves, until a creamy, flavorful sauce is formed.</p>
    </ul>

   <chicken>  My favourite food is Chicken Biryani. It is served with gravy and raita.
It is a flavourful dish that has a rich taste.
It is a famous Indian subcontinent dish that is popular around the world.
Biryani is prepared from basmati rice mixed with several spices and cooked in a special way.
Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani and Veg Biryani are some of the variants of this delicious dish.
This dish is my favourite because it has a lip-smacking flavour, and I love to eat it at least once a week.
My mother prepares very tasty and delicious biryani.
She cooks the dish during weekends or on special occasions.
Biryani is one such mouth-watering dish that is enjoyed by people along with their family and friends.
A Short My Favourite Food Essay Grade 3
I am from Karnataka, and my favourite food is the idli. Idli is a healthy breakfast that is served with delicious coconut chutney and sambar. Idli is soft and fluffy. There are different variants of idli: rave idli, masala idli, flattened rice idli and many more. My grandmother prepares delicious tomato chutney as an accompaniment to soft idli. I love to eat idli with butter and coconut chutney. Idli is the breakfast at our house every Sunday. All my family members sit together and have soft idli prepared by my mother. It tastes best when it is served hot.
